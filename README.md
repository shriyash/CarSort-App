# CarSort: Experimenting with the UIPath Automation Library

CarSort is a UIPath automation tool that simplifies the process of sorting through CarGuru listings. Simply enter details in a CSV file for a car's make, model, your zip code, and price range. Our automation tool will sort through these listings and automatically parse through this data, sorting it neatly for convenience.
